Front-end (Login request ) -> API ->Token 
-If front-end receives token then login successful.
- Front-end decodes after what to decodes

                             1] register
user        <--------------- 2] login
                 Token

                              {below can acces  only if there is token}
                               3] search
                               4] track food

    - When we will login we will get a token
    - To access rest edn-points we need to to verify that token 
    -To access  3 and 4 we will create middleware which will verify the token.

let foods = await trackingModel
      .find({ user_id: userid })
      .populate("user_id");

      -> here populate find value of userid in entire database
